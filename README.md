This repository contains simple Python solutions for three challenges.

1. First challenge takes an integer as input and returns "Even" if the number is even, or "Odd" if the number is odd.
  It uses the modulus operator (%) to check the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
  
2. Second challenge converts a number into its string representation using Python's built-in str() function.

3.Third challenge removes all spaces from a given string. It uses str.split() to break the string into parts and str.join() to reassemble them without spaces.

Each of these problems is designed to practice basic Python syntax and common operations like conditionals, type conversion, and string manipulation.
